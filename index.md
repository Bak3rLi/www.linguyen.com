Xin chào! 你好! Yaama!

I am a linguist specialising in language variation and change, contact linguistics, corpus linguistics. Much of my work is corpora-based and focuses on contact phenomena in bilingual settings. My interest in Linguistics is however diverse, and I have written on a wide range of topics, including variationist linguistics, discourse analysis, heritage language, ethical data collection methods, multilingual NLP and NLP for spoken low-resource varieties. I hold a PhD in Linguistics from the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) and a Masters of General and Applied Linguistics (Advanced) from the [Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/).

I am currently a Research Fellow at the [Australian National University](http://slll.cass.anu.edu.au/), a Research Associate at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/) and a Linguistics Consultant at the [Vietnamese Lexicography Centre](http://www.vietlex.com/). My main project at the moment is the ARDC-funded project [Language Data Commons of Australia](https://ardc.edu.au/news/a-national-language-data-commons-for-australia/), which builds digital infrastruture for language collections in Australia, with my focus specifically on immigrant communities. 

I am particularly interested in projects on language contact, language evolution, heritage speakers, linguistically and socially informed NLP, responsible research methods, and innovative technologies that can accommodate multilingual speakers.
