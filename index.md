# About

Xin chào! 你好! Yaama!

I am a linguist specialising in language variation and change, contact linguistics, and computational sociolinguistics. My research is largely corpus-based, focusing on bilingual contact phenomena and multilingual language use.

My work spans a broad range of topics, including:

- Variationist linguistics
- Heritage language
- Syntax-pragmatic interface in bicultural/bilingual contexts
- Multilingual NLP
- NLP for spoken low-resource varieties

I hold a PhD in Linguistics from the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) and a Master’s in General and Applied Linguistic (Advanced) from the [Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/). I am currently Assistant Professor in Linguistics and Multilingual Studies at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), Singapore.

# Current Interests and Collaboration

I’m particularly interested in:

- Language variation and change in ethnically diverse communities
- Sociolinguistically informed NLP
- Tech innovations for multilingual speakers
