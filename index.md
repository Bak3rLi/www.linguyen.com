# About

Xin chào! 你好! Yaama! 

<img id="my-picture" src="boat.jpg" width="300" height="300" align="right">

I am a linguist specialising in language variation and change, contact linguistics, and computational sociolinguistics. Much of my work is corpora-based and focuses on contact phenomena in bilingual settings. My interest in Linguistics is, however, broad. I have written on a wide range of topics, including variationist linguistics, heritage language, syntax-pragmatic interface in bicultural/bilingual contexts, multilingual NLP, and NLP for spoken low-resource varieties. 

I hold a PhD in Linguistics from the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) and a Masters of General and Applied Linguistics (Advanced) from the [Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/). I am currently Assistant Professor in Linguistics and Multilingual Studies at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), Singapore. 

If you would like to collaborate with me on any areas of my expertise, please feel free to get in touch. Currently, I am particularly invested in projects on language variation and change in ethnically diverse communities, sociolinguistically informed NLP, and innovative technologies that can accommodate multilingual speakers.
