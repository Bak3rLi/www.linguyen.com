# About

Xin chào! 你好! Yaama! 

<img id="my-picture" src="boat.jpg" width="300" height="300" align="right">

I am a linguist specialising in language variation and change, contact linguistics, and computational sociolinguistics. Much of my work is corpora-based and focuses on contact phenomena in bilingual settings. My interest in Linguistics is, however, broad. I have written on a wide range of topics, including variationist linguistics, heritage language, syntax-pragmatic interface in culturally diverse communities, multilingual NLP, and NLP for spoken low-resource varieties. 

I hold a PhD in Linguistics from the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) and a Masters of General and Applied Linguistics (Advanced) from the [Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/). I am currently Assistant Professor in Linguistics and Multilingual Studies at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), Singapore. 

I'm particularly interested in projects on language contact, language evolution, heritage speakers, linguistically and socially informed NLP, responsible research methods, and innovative technologies that can accommodate multilingual speakers. If you are interested in any of these areas and would like to collaborate, please feel free to get in touch. 

I also occasionally provide consultancy services to organisations and companies in my area of expertise.
