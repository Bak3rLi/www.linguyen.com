Xin chào! 你好! Yaama!

I am a linguist specialising in language variation and change, contact linguistics, corpus linguistics. Much of my work is corpora-based and focuses on contact phenomena in bilingual settings. My interest in Linguistics is however diverse, and I have written on a wide range of topics, including variationist linguistics, discourse analysis, heritage language, ethical data collection methods, multilingual NLP and NLP for spoken low-resource varieties. I hold a PhD in Linguistics from the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) and a Masters of General and Applied Linguistics (Advanced) from the [Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/).

I am currently Research Associate at the [Computer Lab](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/) and Director of Studies for Linguistics at [Christ's College](https://www.christs.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge. For 2023, I served as Research Fellow & Lecturer at the [Australian National University](http://slll.cass.anu.edu.au/) where I mainly worked on the ARDC-funded project [Language Data Commons of Australia (LDaCA)](https://ardc.edu.au/news/a-national-language-data-commons-for-australia/).

I am particularly interested in projects on language contact, language evolution, heritage speakers, linguistically and socially informed NLP, responsible research methods, and innovative technologies that can accommodate multilingual speakers. Together with some colleagues in Cambridge, I provide consultancy services to organisations and companies in the area of Linguistics and Language Technology, so feel free to get in touch.
