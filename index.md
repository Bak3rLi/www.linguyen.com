I am a linguist specialising in language variation and change, contact linguistics, corpus linguistics. Much of my work is corpora-based and focuses on contact phenomena in bilingual settings. My interest in Linguistics is however diverse, and I have written on a wide range of topics, including (quantitative) variationist linguistics, (qualitative) discourse analysis, heritage language, ethical data collection methods, multilingual NLP and NLP for spoken low-resource varieties. 

I completed my PhD earlier this year at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) and now work as a Research Associate at the [Cambridge Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/). I am also a Research Affiliate at the [ARC Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of Language (CoEDL)](http://www.dynamicsoflanguage.edu.au/) and a Linguistics Consultant at the [Vietnamese Lexicography Centre](http://www.vietlex.com/). Before that, I was an editor for [Cambridge Occasional Papers in Linguistics (COPiL)](http://www.ling.cam.ac.uk/COPIL/) and a Visitor and a Research Assistant at [ANU School of Literature, Languages and Linguistics](http://slll.cass.anu.edu.au/), where I worked on an [IAFPA](https://www.iafpa.net/)-funded project on forensic voice comparison. 

My PhD, fully funded by the [Cambridge Trust](https://www.cambridgetrust.org/), explored language variation and change across generations in the [Canberra](https://www.britannica.com/place/Australian-Capital-Territory#ref960967) Vietnamese community, using an original, natural corpus of spontaneous speech ([the Canberra Vietnamese-English Corpus/CanVEC](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.lrec-1.507/)). My research specifically considered the extent to which we may automate the processing of multilingual corpora, and examined how this data allowed us to characterise speakers’ linguistic variation and change across both their monolingual and bilingual discourse. Prior to Cambridge, I gained a [Master of General and Applied Linguistics (Advanced)](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/program/VLING) at the [Australian National University (ANU)](http://www.anu.edu.au/), and also a [Bachelor of Arts](https://www.canberra.edu.au/coursesandunits/course?course_cd=922AA&version_number=3) (Honours I) at the [University of Canberra](https://www.canberra.edu.au/). 

I am particularly interested in projects to do with language contact, thoughtful AI, linguistically and socially informed NLP, responsible research methods, and innovative technologies that can accommodate multilingual speakers.
