# About

Xin chào! 你好! Yaama!

I am a linguist specialising in language variation and change, contact linguistics, corpus linguistics. Much of my work is corpora-based and focuses on contact phenomena in bilingual settings. My interest in Linguistics is however diverse, and I have written on a wide range of topics, including variationist linguistics, discourse analysis, heritage language, ethical data collection methods, multilingual NLP and NLP for spoken low-resource varieties. 

I completed my PhD at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) in 2021 and now work as a Research Associate at the [Cambridge Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/). I am also a Linguistics Consultant at the [Vietnamese Lexicography Centre](http://www.vietlex.com/). Before that, I was a co-editor for [Cambridge Occasional Papers in Linguistics (COPiL)](http://www.ling.cam.ac.uk/COPIL/) and a Visitor and a Research Assistant at [ANU School of Literature, Languages and Linguistics](http://slll.cass.anu.edu.au/), where I worked on an [IAFPA](https://www.iafpa.net/)-funded project on forensic voice comparison. 

I am particularly interested in projects on language contact, language evolution, heritage speakers, linguistically and socially informed NLP, responsible research methods, and innovative technologies that can accommodate multilingual speakers.
